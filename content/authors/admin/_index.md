I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute and Natural History Museum, where I work in the Ichthyology Division. I study the evolutionary relationships and morphological diversity of fishes, currently focusing on Beryciformes and Trachichthyiformes, and have historically worked on various deep-sea groups.

My research integrates morphology, molecular data, and ecological context to uncover how form and function evolve, particularly in deep-sea environments such as anglerfishes and their bioluminescent lures.

I welcome inquiries about collaborations and invite you to explore my CV and social media to learn more about my work.
