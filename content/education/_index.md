        ## Museum Outreach

        Sharing a love for the natural world is one of the most rewarding parts of being a scientist. I aim to spark curiosity and excitement about biology, whether in the classroom, lab, or museum.

        Much of my outreach takes place at the **Biodiversity Institute & Natural History Museum at the University of Kansas**, where I participate and lead a variety of events that showcase our collections and research. I enjoy showing visitors how specimens and various preparations allow scientists to explore evolution, ecology, and biology in ways textbooks cannot.

        Some of my favorite demonstrations include 3D-printed fish models from CT-scan data and skeletal specimens I’ve prepared to highlight unusual anatomy and adaptations.

        Every year, I coordinate the **Valentine’s Day "Collections Up Close" event**, highlighting unusual reproductive behaviors across species. A memorable moment was explaining how tiny male ceratioid anglerfish fuse to females, leaving visitors fascinated and engaged.

        Collections are central to my research, providing the specimens and genetic samples that allow me to study species worldwide, examine evolutionary innovations, and understand ecological relationships.

        ## Teaching and Mentoring

        I act as a guide for students, helping them explore complex concepts through hands-on learning. I highlight the weirdest and most interesting features first, compare them to simpler mechanisms, and build understanding from there. Being approachable and relaxed helps students feel comfortable and engaged.

        I have taught and mentored students at undergraduate levels, including courses in Ichthyology, Systematics, Genetics, and Cell Biology. I especially enjoy working with kids and older adults, helping them connect with science in memorable ways.
